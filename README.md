# AI Literacy Tools for K-12

This repository provides a single access point for the three interactive AI literacy tools described in the SIGCSE TS 2026 poster "Interactive Tools for Middle School Students AI Literacy."

These tools help middle school students explore prompting, recommender systems, and deepfake ethics through hands-on activities.

### 1. PromptPeek — Prompting, Bias, & Negation
Students create prompts, reverse-engineer prompts, and examine how generative AI handles bias and failures with negation.

* **Live Demo:** [https://promptpeek.pythonanywhere.com/](https://promptpeek.pythonanywhere.com/)
* **Code:** [https://github.com/saniavn/PromptPeek](https://github.com/saniavn/PromptPeek)

### 2. Bandit Explorer — Recommender System Trade-offs
A simulation of the **exploration–exploitation trade-off** using an epsilon-greedy policy. Students adjust $\epsilon$ (epsilon) to see how recommendations change based on their settings.

### 3. SpotAI — Deepfake Ethics & Media Awareness
Students detect, edit, and reason about real vs. manipulated media, and engage in discussions about ethical scenarios regarding AI-generated content.
